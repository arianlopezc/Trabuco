# AI Context Directory

This directory contains resources for AI coding assistants working on this project.

## Contents

| File/Directory | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `checkpoint.json` | Machine-readable project state for session continuity |
| `prompts/` | Task-specific guides for common development patterns |

## Usage

### Checkpoint

The `checkpoint.json` file tracks:
- Current work in progress
- Completed and pending steps
- Test status
- Important decisions made

AI assistants should:
1. Read the checkpoint at session start to understand context
2. Update the checkpoint when work is completed
3. Record blockers and decisions for future reference

### Task Prompts

When performing a task, read the corresponding guide in `prompts/`:

| Task | Guide |
|------|-------|
| Add new entity | `prompts/add-entity.md` |
{{- if .HasModule "API"}}
| Add REST endpoint | `prompts/add-endpoint.md` |
{{- end}}
{{- if .HasModule "Worker"}}
| Add background job | `prompts/add-job.md` |
{{- end}}
{{- if .HasModule "EventConsumer"}}
| Add event type | `prompts/add-event.md` |
{{- end}}

Each prompt contains:
- Step-by-step instructions
- File locations for changes
- Code examples following project patterns
- Checklist for completion
- Common mistakes to avoid

## For Humans

These files are designed for AI consumption but are human-readable. Feel free to:
- Update `checkpoint.json` manually if needed
- Add custom prompts for recurring tasks
- Extend the schema for project-specific needs
